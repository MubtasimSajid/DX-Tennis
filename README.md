# DX Tennis
DXT, short for DX Tennis, is a simple 2-player single-device game. The idea was to fuse the two simple, yet vastly popular computer games together: DX-Ball &amp; Ping Pong. It was created as our project submission for Structured Programming - 2 lab of the 2nd semester of the CSE-'27 batch of IUT by the team of Mubtasim Sajid Ahmed, AKM Ishmam Tahmid, Mahmudul Hasan Sakib &amp; Obaidullah. The language used was C & the graphics were rendered using the iGraphics library, which enables developing GUI in C/C++. Sprites drawn with pixel art were sprinkled all around to give the game a playful aesthetic identity.

## Gameplay
Two players control two paddles, one using the keyboard and the other using the mouse. W & S are pressed to move the left bat up or down, respectively & the left & right mouse down do the same for the player to the right. Each player is given a set of bricks to protect. The player to first destroy their opponent's wall fully wins.
A demo video to demonstrate a full play through for a round is uploaded on Facebook: [DX Tennis Video on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16D2NfVD7j/)

## Features
1. The game has three difficulty levels to allow the players to tune the game's pacing.
2. There are four types of power-ups (invisibility, board elongation, brick regeneration & fireball) which will spawn at random positions & times during the playthrough. The player to last hit the ball gets to enjoy the power-ups' special advantages (invisibility is rather disadvantageous & fireball has the same effect for both players).
3. Bricks are of three types: the regular brown ones hold up for a single shot, the red ones can endure up to 2 hits & the iron bricks take 3.

We hope that you will find DX Tennis enjoyable & entertaining. Please note that you must have iGraphics properly installed on your machine to compile the files. Cheers!
