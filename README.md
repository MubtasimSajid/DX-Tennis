# DX-Tennis
DX Tennis, or DXT in short, in a simple 2-players single device game. The idea for it was to fusion the two popular games: DX Ball &amp; Ping Pong. It was created as our project submission for Structured Programming - 2 lab of 2nd semester of CSE-'27 batch of IUT by the team of Mubtasim Sajid Ahmed, AKM Ishmam Tahmid, Mahmudul Hasan Sakib &amp; Obaidullah. The language used was C & the graphics were rendered ussing iGraphics from BUET.

## Gameplay
Two players control tow paddles, one using the keyboard, the other mouse. W & S are pressed to move the left bat up or down, respectively & the left & right mouse down do the same for the player to the right. Each player is given a set of bricks to protect. The player to first estroy their opponents wall fully wins.

## Features
1. The game has three difficulty levels to allow the players to tune the pacing of the game.
2. There are four types of power-ups (invisibility, board elongation, brick regenration & fireball) which will spawn at random positions & time during the playthrough. The player to last hit the ball gets to enjoy the power-ups' special advantages (invisibility is rather disadvantageous & fireball has same effect for both the players).
3. Bricks are of three types: the regular brown ones hold up for a single shot, red ones can ednure upto 2 hits & the iron bricks take 3.

We hope that you will find DX Tennis enjoyable & entertaining. Please note that you must have iGraphics properly installed on your machine to run the files. Thank you!
